Communications lab video assignment

## Project Name: Fever Dream 


## Process 
- Audio Recording and Video Shooting 

This part took a lot of effort and time. We had to shoot and reshoot a lot of parts until we got what we wanted. It was a fun process with a lot of trial and error because we are not experts. We had to ask some of our friends to act and we had to stay up late at night to shoot when the Art center was empty. We also had to get some things from the prop loan in the Art center. For the audio we used the zoom recording and for the actual filming we used a phone and a tripod. 

## Work Distribution:
We all brainstormed for different ideas and planned the process and wireframe of how it will work. Then we divided the work among ourselves. We all worked on the README file. 

**Shahd**: I had to work on a shot list, at least to imagine how things will work out. Then I had to map out how the story line will change and how that will be edited. Then, I moved on to the shooting part which took many hours and a lot of time. I then started editing audio and the video which also took me a lot of time.  

   
**Izah**: After collaboratively working on choosing a concept and story, my primary role was working on the website with Jiho. Given that the essence of our film revolves around a psychological experience, I aimed to ensure that the website's interface seamlessly complemented this theme. I worked a lot with JavaScript for this assignment to add more interactivity and create a more immersive experience. One of these interative features is the slider on the home page. The initial arrow (pill) position is strategically set as a percentage of the screen width. As users slide halfway across the slider, several dynamic changes occur:
  - The background color undergoes a smooth transition into a darker theme, symbolizing the initiation of the psychological journey. I considered changing the background back to the original one if the user slides back but decided not to as I feel this fits our concept better: once you reach a certain point, there is no returning
  - some text appears at the center of the screen offering users a brief insight into what lies ahead.
  - background music starts playing. I initially wanted the background music to play automatically however, after a lot of playing around with code and searching online, I realised autoplay isn't possible. So I decided to implement the audio feature this way and personally, I believe this approach contributes significantly better to the overall user experience!

  Sliding all the way to the end of the slider takes the user to the video experience page. 
  
  Here I added:
  - a back to home button with some basic styling so the user can go back to the home page and restart the experience.
  - At the end of each video, the user is given a choice between 2 options so I had to figure out how to implement that. Again, I had to work with a lot of javascript code to make this possible since we also had to play specific videos depending on the choices made by the user.
  - I also added a typewriter text effect to text that is displayed at the end of each video for a better user experience.

   **Jiho**:
  I worked mostly with html, css and the front page design for this assignment. It took an unnecessary amount of time specifically when designing the homepage because I was experiencing artist's block. I tried centering texts, manipulating fonts, playing around with colours but none seemed to coordinate harmoniously. In fact, we had to ditch our initial design idea because nothing seemed to align with our concept. I thought it was better to start anew rather than hold onto something that clearly wasn't working so I got to brainstorming other potential ideas. Unfortunately the vision didn't end up working because 1) it looked tacky on the website and 2) it was pixelated and low quality hence I had to scrap this too. In the end, I decided to go for minimalism which is how our front page came to fruition: pierre holding a red or blue pill, like those featured in the video, with a slight rainbow glow to symbolise hallucination. Whilst I was skeptical about this design, I think it worked the best out of all the other previous designs and took a significantly shorter time to produce. However, the positioning of everything using html was an immense pain. Everything had to be placed in this order, from background to foreground: 1) rainbow aura, 2) title, 3) pierre, 4) description/ slider. Whilst manipulating the z-index helped achieve this order, it also pushed certain divs from the center and so fixing this took an unprecedented amount of time.
  Furthermore, with regards to decorating the button with css, it was also an incredibly time consuming job as the effect we were trying to implement was so complicated. We found that our css button used scss code which we then had to translate into our familiar css. Hence the process served an arduous experience, there was a lot of guesswork involved. we included excluded specific parts of the code, moved it around to target a specific part of an element so that everything would work. Whilst some parts we found were lacking and would have liked to edit even further, we thought it was best the way it is, especially with considerations to the time constraint that we had determined for ourselves. We made it to mimic the red pill blue pill to show that these choices have major effects to the storyline. 

**Pierre**:

   After brainstorming, I crafted the script for the story. Creating the story demanded considerable effort as we aimed for authenticity and originality. I delved into research to explore ways to introduce the concept or the primary cause of the "hallucination" until I stumbled upon the ideal connecting element: the pill. This choice stemmed from the fact that drugs are one of the factors behind hallucinations, symbolized by the pill â€“ not necessarily a drug itself but something entering the body to induce the desired effect. With the narrative structured and transitions between scenes set, we started filming. I was the solo actor in this short movie. However, it was more challenging than expected. We had to redo the shots several times because my appearance while acting didn't match how I had pictured it. Additionally, we encountered numerous hurdles during filming, resorting to borrowing a skateboard and having strangers help to capture the shots we needed just to mention a few. Shahd and I worked on preparing all the equipment and accessories for the shooting from the camera equipment to the rope and the colored pills.


## Reflection and Evaluation: 

**Shahd**: I really enjoyed making the video and editing it. There was a lot of unused footage and we repeated many shots for accuracy reasons. To be honest I had so many doubts this idea would work; however, we all wanted to implement it and try our best to make it work. I believe this is why it worked out just fine. 

Of Course there is still a lot that can be done to make it more complex and interesting but I liked it because we all go through things that we can not explain and that was our main goal for the story. I would have liked it more if we can make an about page and behind the scenes video
 
**Izah**:

**Jiho**: Whilst again, this project felt like a gamble in the sense that it would either be a hit or miss due to its complexity, I was incredibly happy with the final result. I think overall everything including the design, video editing and audio interlaced really well together and so I had no complaints regarding the final result. However for future reference, it would interesting to make a more complex story where each decision significantly alters the story path and whilst this would be very ambitious to take on, i would love to see it come to fruition. 

**Pierre**: No words can fully convey how rewarding this journey has been. Creating my first-ever short movie, from scripting to filming and editing, feels like a significant milestone. It may not be Oscar-worthy, but it represents a huge step forward. I gained invaluable experience from overcoming numerous challenges throughout the process. While the final movie isn't precisely what I initially imagined, it's incredibly beautiful to see how everything came together.
