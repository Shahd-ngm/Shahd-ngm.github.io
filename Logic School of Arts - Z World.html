                <p class="aboutUs">Welcome to the enigmatic and surreal realm of Z of Arts, a world where everything is a
                    new logic. In Z of Arts, we invite you to explore the unconventional, challenge your perceptions, and
                    embrace the bizarre. This is not Earth this is a new dimention where everything is not what it seems. In
                    Z World, what you think you know is merely the beginning. Here, chaos is our canvas, and contradictions
                    is our medium. Our artists revel in the absurd, finding beauty in the bizarre, and meaning in the
                    paradoxical. Prepare to question everything you thought you understood about art, for in Z of Arts, the
                    ordinary is dull, and the extraordinary is commonplace.</p>

                <h5 class="topic"> Brief History </h5>

                <p class="history"> In 1050, the School of Art in Z World was intiated by a group of Artists on Earth who
                    rebelled againest the norms. They all took a spaceship and found a new dimension where art was
                    re-invented. They envisioned a place where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur, and
                    where the unexpected thrives. And so, Z of Arts was born.</p>
