    <h4 class= "header" >About Us</h4>
    
    <p class= "aboutUs" >Welcome to the enigmatic and surreal realm of Z of Arts, a world where everything is a new logic.  In Z of Arts, we invite you to explore the unconventional, challenge your perceptions, and embrace the bizarre. This is not Earth this is a new dimention where verything is not what it seems. In Z World, what you think you know is merely the beginning. Here, chaos is our canvas, and contradictions is  our medium. Our artists revel in the absurd, finding beauty in the bizarre, and meaning in the paradoxical. Prepare to question everything you thought you understood about art, for in Z of Arts, the ordinary is mundane, and the extraordinary is commonplace.</p>

     <h4 class= "header" > Brief History </h4>

    <p class= "history"> In 3050, the School of Art in Z World was intiated by a group of Artists on Earth who rebelled againest the norms. They all took a spaceship and found a new dimension where art was re-invented. They envisioned a place where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur, and where the unexpected thrives. And so, Z of Arts was born.</p>
